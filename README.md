# LoremIpsumGenerator
- Taught me more about using Modules in JS, which in this case it is the npm lorem-ipsum package.
- Uses require() to import the module.
- Due to me using a module in JS, first time I used addEventListener() in JS instead of using onclick in HTML for functionality.
- Automatically adds new p elements based on how many paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum generated.
